                    <h2>Desktop Support Intern (NFCU)</h2>
                    <p>&emsp; To begin my professional development in IT I obtained a year-round internship at Navy Federal Credit Union on their Desktop Support team in May 2019. While there I developed a large amount of professional skills such as, effective communication, customer service, documentation and more. Alongside this, I was able to help strengthen my technical and troubleshooting skills. I automated fixes to certain issues by teaching myself PowerShell scripting and I also gained in depth knowledge on a lot of applications used throughout many professional enterprises. Eventually, I left this team in May 2021 to begin a position that used coding on a daily basis.</p>

                    <h2>Business Systems Analyst Intern (NFCU)</h2>
                    <p>&emsp; I began this position in May 2021 and here is where my coding kowledge began to skyrocket. I was able to learn two new languages within a few months and start working on professional applications. Within my first month, I was able to pick up and learn AutoIT, a rather old language with some limited functionalities, which took a little to get used to. Afterwards, I began to learn C# for this role as we were using it for newer applications and development. In addition, I've gained a large amount of insight into the professional development process. I've had to adhere to coding standards and security policies and have had my work peer reviewed by multiple senior developers. </p>

                    <h2>Before IT</h2>
                    <p>&emsp; I have only had one job before entering the professional workplace and that was as a basketball trainer for one of my highschool coaches. My coach had a basketball training company named Ultimate Basketball Training that was located in Springfield, VA. There I would assist him in running daily training sessions for kids, generally ages 10-18, and help them further their basketball skills. I did this from my sophomore year of highschool until my sophomore year of college. To this day, it's been one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had as I could often see the same passion for basketball in them that I had when I was a kid. </p>
